I am a Ph.D. student in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

I became a member of the [TELOS](https://telos-syslab.github.io/) system lab in September 2021, advised by Prof. [Xiaolin Wang](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1083/1703.htm). Before coming to TELOS, I received my B.S. in computer science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021.

Research
======
My research focuses on HW/SW co-design tailored for modern cloud computing and data center systems. I am particularly interested in resource allocation strategies, task scheduling methodologies, and shared resource partitioning techniques in data centers.
