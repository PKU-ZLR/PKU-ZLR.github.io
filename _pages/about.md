I am a PhD student in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

I became a member of the [TELOS](https://telos-syslab.github.io/) system lab in September 2021, advised by Prof. [Xiaolin Wang](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1083/1703.htm). Before coming to TELOS, I received my B.S. in computer science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021.

Research
======
My research interests primarily lie in the fields of Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Program Analysis. My current research focuses on co-designing hardware, software, and programming analysis for resource allocation and task scheduling techniques in next-generation data centers.

Feel free to drop me an email if youâ€™d like to chat!
